The first component is the ImageRecognition component. This component takes an array of image links and shuffle them into a grid. When this grid is done displaying, it calls a function in the componentWillUnmount() function that returns a timestamp, the time displayed, the correct image name, the correct image coordinate in the grid, and the 2D array of the image links. (empty strings indicate no image at that box).

The second component is ImageRecognitionQuestion. This component takes the correct image name, coordinate, and image links grid from the first component. This component will display a grid and an image prompt. The user can select a box in the grid. Every time the user selects a box, the selection handler will be called with data on the click. This function's data will include the timestamp, whether it was a selection or deselection, the selected coordinate, the image at the coordinate if there is any, and whether the answer is correct or incorrect. When the component is about to be unmounted, a function is called that has data on the timestamp, an array of the user box selection history, the correct image name, the correct image coordinate, the image links grid, and whether the user correctly answered the question based on the last user selection.

index.js
This just tests the two components, it first displays the first component for some time, and the unmounts it and displays the second question.
